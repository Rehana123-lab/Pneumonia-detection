# Pneumonia-detection
This project aims to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images using deep learning models like CNN, VGG16, and MobileNetV2, along with classical machine learning algorithms supported by PCA. A GUI was also developed to enable users to upload X-ray images and receive instant predictions.
